I HAVE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD GR-PEACH.

If you wanted GR-Peach of lib, you could import conn_gr_noerror.lib in your computer.

Oh! can't come to grips with the kicad_mod?
It is time to settle down.

kicad_mod of GR-Peach's file name is "Arduino_UNO_R3.kicad_mod."

Just a slip to mod, lib in your C:\~~~ and you done.
